# HireHound
Hirehound is a simple web application designed to help you keep track of your job applications. With this app, you can log your job applications, save important details about each job, and track your progress through the hiring process.

# Features (to come...)
* **Add new job applications**: Record details such as job title, company name, job description, application date, and application status.
* **View all applications** : See a list of all your job applications in one place.
* Search and filter applications: Quickly find specific job applications based on keywords, status, or date range.
* **Update job application status**: Keep track of your progress through the hiring process by updating the status of your job applications.
**Delete applications**: Remove applications from your list that are no longer relevant.

# Technologies Used
* **Backend**: The app uses Go and the [Fiber framework](https://gofiber.io/ "Fiber framework") to handle the server-side logic.
* **Database**: Job application data is stored in a PostgreSQL database.
* **Frontend**: The frontend is built using Svelte + Typescript
* **Deployment**: The deployment for this webapp is done via [Railway.app](https://railway.app/ "Railway.app"). Follows monorepo structure; all frontend code is maintained within the `/frontend` directory and `/backend` for...well the backend
